# Node.js

We used Node.js as the runtime then we used Express as a framework to focus on the use of middlewares.
To display dynamic html pages, we used three template engines pug, ejs, and handlebars. All files are enclosed here, though we would proceed with ejs as it uses both html and normal javascript-ish syntax.
